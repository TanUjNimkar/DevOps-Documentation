Q:Why didn’t you use Ubuntu 24.04 for Jenkins?

Say this:

“Jenkins prioritizes stability over newest OS releases.
Ubuntu 24.04 ships with Java 21 and newer system components, which can cause compatibility issues with Jenkins and plugins.
For OS-level Jenkins, I prefer Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
If I use Ubuntu 24.04, I run Jenkins in Docker to avoid host dependency issues.”


Q: Interview-ready answer (memorize this)

“In real environments, Jenkins is installed once using automation scripts or EC2 user-data. Manual installation is only for learning or PoC.”
